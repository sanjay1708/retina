Retina is an appliation to help people suffering from computer vision syndrome.
Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a condition resulting from focusing the eyes on a computer or other display device for protracted, uninterrupted periods of time and the eye's muscles being unable to recover from the constant tension required to maintain focus on a close object. Some symptoms of CVS include headaches, blurred vision, neck pain, fatigue, eye strain, dry eyes, irritated eyes, double vision, vertigo/dizziness, polyopia, and difficulty refocusing the eyes. 

A routinely recommended approach to reduce eye strain is to consciously blink the eyes every now and then (this helps replenish the tear film) and to look out the window to a distant object or to the sky—doing so provides rest to the ciliary muscles. One of the catch phrases is the "20–20–20 rule". every 20 minutes, focus the eyes on an object 20 feet (6 meters) away for 20 seconds. 

But most of us forget to follow this rule. Retina helps us to follow it.
